This site is built with [11ty](https://11ty.dev/) and hosted on GitHub Pages.

To build the site locally you will need Node.js and npm. If you have Node, run
the following in your local working copy directory:
```sh
$ npm i
$ npm run serve # or `build` for just file generation
```

If all worked as hoped, you can visit https://localhost:8080/ to test the site.
